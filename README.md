D003 - 9º Checkpoint - Created a method "subtracao" in the calculator class.

D003 - 10º Checkpoint - The first method "multiplicacao" is called with two arguments, an instance of "Multiplicador" and "Multiplicando",
Inside the method, the attribute number, of each one "multiplicador" and "multiplicando", are multiplied and the result is returned like a Resultado type,
inside a new instance of "Resultado" class. And the second method "multiplicacao" goes through the same process of the first method, but,
this method await a List like return, so, an instance of arraylist is created to store the variable resultado, and the result is added to the list,
and finally return a type Resultado like a list.
